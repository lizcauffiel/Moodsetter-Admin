We have created two different web applications to change the LED light colors of the Mood Setter. There are three pages where the user can change the LED light colors: My Colors, Mood Color Selection, and Preset Color Selection. The user simply creates their desirable color on My Colors page. On the other hand,  the user can pick a color on the Mood or Preset Color Selection pages. Moreover, the websites contain About, FAQ and Contact pages.
